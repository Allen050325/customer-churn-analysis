📊 Customer Churn Analysis for a Retail Bank

(Applied Data Analytics Project)

⸻

1. Project Overview

This project analyses customer churn behaviour for a hypothetical Australian retail bank.
The objective is to identify key factors associated with customer churn and provide data-driven insights that can support business decision-making.

Rather than focusing on software development, this project emphasises applied data analysis, business understanding, and the ability to translate analytical results into actionable recommendations.

2. Business Context

Customer retention is a critical challenge for retail banks, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
Understanding why customers leave (churn) allows organisations to:
	•	Improve customer experience
	•	Reduce revenue loss
	•	Design targeted retention strategies

This project simulates a realistic business scenario commonly faced by Australian financial institutions.

3. Problem Statement

Which customer characteristics and behaviours are most strongly associated with customer churn?

Specifically, this project aims to:
	•	Explore patterns and trends in customer data
	•	Identify variables correlated with churn
	•	Assess whether churn can be predicted using basic analytical models

⸻

4. Dataset
	•	Publicly available customer churn dataset
	•	Data includes customer demographics, service usage, and account-related attributes
	•	Dataset structure reflects typical retail banking customer information

(Note: The dataset does not belong to any real bank and is used purely for analytical demonstration.)

5. Analytical Approach

5.1 Data Preparation
	•	Data loading and inspection
	•	Handling missing values
	•	Feature selection and transformation

5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Distribution analysis of key variables
	•	Comparison between churned and non-churned customers
	•	Visualisation of behavioural and demographic patterns

5.3 Modelling (Exploratory)
	•	Baseline analytical model for churn prediction
	•	Feature importance analysis
	•	Model performance evaluation

The modelling component is exploratory and intended to support insights rather than achieve optimal predictive performance.

6. Key Findings

Key insights identified from the analysis include:
	•	Certain customer attributes show strong association with churn
	•	Usage patterns and service engagement are more informative than demographics alone
	•	Specific customer segments exhibit significantly higher churn risk

These findings highlight opportunities for early intervention and targeted retention strategies.

⸻

7. Business Implications

Based on the analysis, potential business actions include:
	•	Developing targeted retention programs for high-risk customer segments
	•	Improving service offerings linked to churn behaviour
	•	Prioritising customer engagement efforts based on data-driven risk indicators

The project demonstrates how data analytics can support strategic and operational decisions in a retail banking context.

8. Limitations
	•	The dataset is simulated and may not fully capture real-world complexity
	•	External factors influencing customer behaviour are not included
	•	The model is exploratory and not production-ready

⸻

9. Future Improvements

Potential extensions of this project include:
	•	Incorporating additional behavioural or transactional data
	•	Applying more advanced machine learning models
	•	Building dashboards to communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders

⸻

10. Tools & Technologies
	•	Python
	•	pandas, numpy
	•	matplotlib / seaborn
	•	scikit-learn

⸻

11. Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed skills in:
	•	Applied data analysis and exploratory analytics
	•	Translating business problems into analytical tasks
	•	Communicating insights clearly and effectively
	•	Working with real-world style datasets in an IT context
